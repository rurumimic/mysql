## Connecting to and Disconnecting from the Server

```bash
mysql -u user -p
mysql -h host -u user -p
```

```sql
mysql> \q
mysql> quit
Bye
```

## Entering Queries

```sql
SELECT VERSION(), CURRENT_DATE;

+-----------+--------------+
| VERSION() | CURRENT_DATE |
+-----------+--------------+
| 5.7.29    | 2020-03-16   |
+-----------+--------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

- Keywords may be entered in any lettercase.
- A query normally consists of an SQL statement followed by a semicolon.
- If you decide you do not want to execute a query that you are in the process of entering, cancel it by typing `\c`

## Creating and Using a Database

### Creating and Selecting a Database

#### SHOW

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;

+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
```

SHOW DATABASES does not show databases that you have no privileges for if you do not have the SHOW DATABASES privilege.

#### CREATE DATABASE

```sql
CREATE DATABASE menagerie;
```

#### USE

```sql
USE menagerie
```

`USE`, like `QUIT`, does not require a semicolon.

You can see at any time which database is currently selected using:

```sql
SELECT DATABASE();
```

### Creating a Table

#### SHOW TALBES

```sql
SHOW TABLES;

Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

#### CREATE TABLE

```sql
CREATE TABLE pet (name VARCHAR(20), owner VARCHAR(20),
species VARCHAR(20), sex CHAR(1), birth DATE, death DATE);
```

```sql
SHOW TABLES;

+---------------------+
| Tables_in_menagerie |
+---------------------+
| pet                 |
+---------------------+
```

#### DESCRIBE

```sql
DESCRIBE pet;

+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field   | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| name    | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| owner   | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| species | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| sex     | char(1)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| birth   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| death   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
```

### Loading Data into a Table

#### pet.txt

Copy the text and create a text file `pet.txt`.  

```bash
mysql> quit
vi pet.txt
```

```txt
Fluffy	Harold	cat	f	1993-02-04	\N
Claws	Gwen	cat	m	1994-03-17	\N
Buffy	Harold	dog	f	1989-05-13	\N
Fang	Benny	dog	m	1990-08-27	\N
Bowser	Diane	dog	m	1979-08-31	1995-07-29
Chirpy	Gwen	bird	f	1998-09-11	\N
Whistler	Gwen	bird	\N	1997-12-09	\N
Slim	Benny	snake	m	1996-04-29	\N
```

#### LOAD DATA

Connect to the server.

```bash
mysql -u root -p menagerie
```

Load a text file.

```sql
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '~/pet.txt' INTO TABLE pet;

Query OK, 8 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 8  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0
```

You can specify the column value separator and end of line marker explicitly in the LOAD DATA statement if you wish, but the defaults are tab and linefeed.

#### INSERT

```sql
INSERT INTO pet
VALUES ('Puffball','Diane','hamster','f','1999-03-30',NULL);
```

### Retrieving Information from a Table

#### Selecting All Data

##### SELECT

```sql
SELECT * FROM pet;

+----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name     | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
+----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| Fluffy   | Harold | cat     | f    | 1993-02-04 | NULL       |
| Claws    | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL       |
| Buffy    | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL       |
| Fang     | Benny  | dog     | m    | 1990-08-27 | NULL       |
| Bowser   | Diane  | dog     | m    | 1979-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
| Chirpy   | Gwen   | bird    | f    | 1998-09-11 | NULL       |
| Whistler | Gwen   | bird    | NULL | 1997-12-09 | NULL       |
| Slim     | Benny  | snake   | m    | 1996-04-29 | NULL       |
| Puffball | Diane  | hamster | f    | 1999-03-30 | NULL       |
+----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
```

##### DELETE

```sql
DELETE FROM pet;
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '~/pet.txt' INTO TABLE pet;
```

##### UPDATE

```sql
UPDATE pet SET birth = '1989-08-31' WHERE name = 'Bowser';
```

#### Selecting Particular Rows

- **WHERE**
- **AND**
- **OR**

```sql
SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name = 'Bowser';
SELECT * FROM pet WHERE birth >= '1998-1-1';
SELECT * FROM pet WHERE species = 'dog' AND sex = 'f';
SELECT * FROM pet WHERE species = 'snake' OR species = 'bird';
SELECT * FROM pet WHERE (species = 'cat' AND sex = 'm') 
       OR (species = 'dog' AND sex = 'f');
```

#### Selecting Particular Columns

```sql
SELECT name, birth FROM pet;
SELECT owner FROM pet;
SELECT DISTINCT owner FROM pet;
SELECT name, species, birth FROM pet 
       WHERE species = 'dog' OR species = 'cat';
```

#### Sorting Rows

- **ORDER BY**
- **ASC**
- **DESC**

```sql
SELECT name, birth FROM pet ORDER BY birth;
SELECT name, birth FROM pet ORDER BY birth DESC;
SELECT name, species, birth FROM pet 
       ORDER BY species, birth DESC;
```

#### Date Calculations

```sql
SELECT name, birth, CURDATE(),
       TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR,birth,CURDATE()) AS age
       FROM pet;
SELECT name, birth, CURDATE(),
       TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR,birth,CURDATE()) AS age
       FROM pet ORDER BY name;
SELECT name, birth, CURDATE(),
       TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR,birth,CURDATE()) AS age
       FROM pet ORDER BY age;
SELECT name, birth, death,
       TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR,birth,death) AS age
       FROM pet WHERE death IS NOT NULL ORDER BY age;
SELECT name, birth, MONTH(birth) FROM pet;
SELECT name, birth FROM pet WHERE MONTH(birth) = 5;
SELECT name, birth FROM pet
       WHERE MONTH(birth) = MONTH(DATE_ADD(CURDATE(),INTERVAL 1 MONTH));
SELECT name, birth FROM pet
       WHERE MONTH(birth) = MOD(MONTH(CURDATE()), 12) + 1;
```

If a calculation uses invalid dates, the calculation fails and produces warnings:

```sql
SELECT '2018-10-31' + INTERVAL 1 DAY;
SELECT '2018-10-32' + INTERVAL 1 DAY;
SHOW WARNINGS;
```

#### Working with NULL Values

- In MySQL, 0 or `NULL` means false and anything else means true. 
- The default truth value from a boolean operation is 1.
- Two `NULL` values are regarded as equal in a `GROUP BY`.
- When doing an `ORDER BY`, `NULL` values are presented first if you do `ORDER BY` ... `ASC` and last if you do `ORDER BY` ... `DESC`.
- 

```sql
SELECT 1 IS NULL, 1 IS NOT NULL;
```

You cannot use arithmetic comparison operators such as =, <, or <> to test for NULL.

```sql
SELECT 1 = NULL, 1 <> NULL, 1 < NULL, 1 > NULL;
```

```sql
SELECT 0 IS NULL, 0 IS NOT NULL, '' IS NULL, '' IS NOT NULL;
```

#### Pattern Matching

```sql
SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name LIKE 'b%';
SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name LIKE '%fy';
SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name LIKE '%w%';
SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name LIKE '_____';
SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP '^b';
SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP BINARY '^b';
SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP 'fy$';
SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP 'w';
SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP '^.....$';
SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP '^.{5}$';
```

#### Counting Rows

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pet;
SELECT owner, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY owner;
SELECT species, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY species;
SELECT sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY sex;
SELECT species, sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY species, sex;
SELECT species, sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet
       WHERE species = 'dog' OR species = 'cat'
       GROUP BY species, sex;
SELECT species, sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet
       WHERE sex IS NOT NULL
       GROUP BY species, sex;
```

- `sql_mode='ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY'`
